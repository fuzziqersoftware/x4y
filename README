x4y: a derived startup name generator

Frequently asked questions:
  What does this thing even do?
    It generates phrases of the form "X: it's Y for Z!", mocking tech companies
    that position themselves as such.
  Why?
    Because Silicon Valley is ridiculous.
  Why is this written in assembly?
    Because it was the best tool for the job, obviously.
  This seems dumb.
    You are correct.

Enjoy. Or don't. The choice is yours.
